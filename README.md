# ðŸ§  Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository!  
This repo is a collection of everything Iâ€™m learning and building as I dive deep into ML â€” from the basics of Python and math, to beginner projects, interview prep, and beyond.  
The goal is simple: **learn, document, and share** so that others can learn with me too.
